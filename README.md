# Project Description

  There is a lack of standardization in reporting of 210Pb dating of sediment cores. Our objectives are several fold.
  1. To assess  current practices in reporting through a literature review 
  2. Recommend minimum reporting requirements for authors to ensure models can be reproduced and for adequate uncertainty assessment
  3. Using recommendations for reporting to advise database structuring for geochronology components of repository records
  4. Outreach to the academic community to promote best practices
